Week 2 Question – Chapter 1: Making Inevitable Conflict Productive



Student: Fadhil Ahmed

Question



Chapter 1 suggests that conflict between employees and managers is inevitable as each operate under different agendas. Should employees be responsible for managing this conflict upward? by emphasizing employee adaptation, are we risking excusing poor management?



Context



This question matters to me because, in my role as an RA, I’ve repeatedly had to adapt and manage conflict with supervisors. However, this adaptation showed me both the benefits and limitation of managing conflicts upward. I hear a lot about emphasizing communication and being a good RA, but is that framework risking poor management?
