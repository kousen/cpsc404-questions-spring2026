You mention that in the business world, unlike school, working together is assumed and the goal is simply to get the job done. As a first-year analyst, I know that building trust early on is key to getting staffed on major deals. How do I distinguish between 'productive struggle'—which builds my own technical expertise—and 'spinning my wheels,' which actually hurts the team's efficiency? Is there a specific 'good-enough' time limit I should set before I pivot from individual problem-solving to seeking a collaborative answer?
