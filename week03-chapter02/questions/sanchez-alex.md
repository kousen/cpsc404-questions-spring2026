## Question
How does being a responsive employee with credibility differ from being a competent employee, and why does the use of good-enough answers support this difference?
## Context 
Being an employee is one thing but being a responsive employee with credibility is greater. Learning how to employ good-enough answers demonstrates this as being responsive builds constructive loyalty relationship.  The boss has high expectations over their employees and taking their questions very seriously and providing a fast response is fundamental in building a strong relationship with credibility.
