## Question

Chapter 2 argues that “a good-enough answer today is much, much better than a great answer next week,” and offers a template: “I don’t know, but… here’s what I do know / here’s what I think / here’s what I would do to figure it out,” followed by “Do you want me to look into it?”

In practice, how should a working professional decide when giving a good-enough answer builds trust and momentum versus when it risks creating a reputation for being shallow or unreliable, especially given the reminder that “employees advise; managers decide”?

## Context (optional)

The chapter frames “good-enough answers” as a responsiveness tool that reduces your boss’s waiting/frustration and turns ambiguity into a decision point for the manager (whether it’s worth more time to get a full answer). It also claims this kind of responsiveness may be one of the fastest ways to build a loyalty-based relationship with your manager over time.
