## Question
As an employee who is dedicated to becoming the best programmer they can be, how do you break down the interior barrier of only wanting to produce the best quality of work you can, if you are at a company that is only looking for good-enough solutions. Do you allow yourself to conform to what is best for your boss/company/profit if deep down you know this is not how you should be deploying great products.
