## Question

In Chapter 2, the author explains the "informational asymmetry" that exists because managers manage the boundary between the team and the rest of the organization. If a manager makes a decision that seems technically counterproductive—such as deprioritizing a critical security patch in a cloud environment to meet a quarterly business goal—how can an employee distinguish between a decision based on "hidden" organizational context (that we should support) versus a decision based on a manager’s personal "fear, uncertainty, or doubt" (FUD)? At what point does our role as advisors require us to challenge that asymmetry to ensure the manager is fully aware of the technical risks they are accepting?

## Context (optional)

The chapter emphasizes that "bosses are people first" and that they often have different incentives than their technical staff. It also introduces the idea that while we advise, they decide. I am interested in how we effectively "manage up" when the information gap makes it difficult to tell if a manager is making an informed business trade-off or simply an uniformed technical mistake.
