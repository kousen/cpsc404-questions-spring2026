## Question

In the 'Game of School,' using outside resources is cheating, but in the 'Game of Business,' it is expected. In addition, the book mentions professionals often resist giving partial answers because they are trained to be 'problem solvers' who fix things completely. Does the 'Good-Enough Answer' strategy actually solve the business problem (the manager's anxiety), or does it merely defer the technical problem, potentially creating 'technical debt' in communication?
