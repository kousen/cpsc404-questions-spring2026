## Question

If you’re leading an open-source project inside a company, how do you apply “I got this / I got your back” without accidentally creating a culture where the lead absorbs all responsibility, shields decision-making from scrutiny, and discourages new maintainers from gaining visible authority?

## Context

Chapter 4 emphasizes consistently sending two signals to your manager: “I got this” (owning outcomes) and “I got your back” (showing loyalty, especially in how you represent them to others). Chapter 8 of *Producing OSS* argues that managing participants is partly about credibility, “politics,” and delegation as a social signal that builds trust and commitment.
