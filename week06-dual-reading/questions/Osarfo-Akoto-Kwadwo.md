## Question

Kousen emphasizes sending the "I got this" message, which means taking full ownership and responsibility for a hard problem to build your manager's trust. However, in Chapter 8 of Managing Participants, Fogel warns heavily against "territoriality," noting that when developers stake exclusive claims on areas of code, it fractures the egalitarian spirit of the project and creates a single point of failure. If you are tasked with leading a critical module in a hybrid corporate/open-source project, how do you confidently communicate "I got this" to your corporate manager without accidentally putting up "no trespassing" signs that alienate open-source volunteers who might otherwise review or contribute to your area?
