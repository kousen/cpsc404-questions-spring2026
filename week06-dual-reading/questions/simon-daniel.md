## Question

Having an “I got this” attitude can be a great thing because it shows 
confidence and a sense of ownership. At the same time, Chapter 8 warns 
that people can become territorial, holding too tightly to roles or 
decisions. How can leaders encourage people to take initiative without it 
turning into defensiveness or a reluctance to work with others?
