## Question

In HYBHY Chapter 4, the author defines the two critical messages as "I got this" and "I got your back." Conversely, ProducingOSS Chapter 8 discusses handling "difficult" contributors who are technically talented but socially challenging. If a contributor is clearly signaling "I got this" through high-quality code, but fails to signal "I got your back" by ignoring community norms or being abrasive, should a maintainer still value them? Is it possible to have "constructive loyalty" in an open-source project when a participant is technically elite but socially "unreasonable"?
