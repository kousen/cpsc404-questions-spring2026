## Question

How would you handle the "transitions" in professional office settings? In other words, how would you react when it becomes evident that your manager will be "transitioned away" due to their own incompetence, while maintaining the "I Got Your Back" strategy and professional trust with other managers and their bosses?

## Context (optional)

The strategies described in the "Transitions" section of the POSS book, while useful for open-source collaboration environment, includes the elements of the "throwing under the buss" behavior that HYBHY discourages from being used in a professional environment.
