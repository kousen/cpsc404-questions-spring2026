# Week 6 Dual-Reading Question — HYBHY Ch. 4 + Producing OSS Ch. 8

## Question

HYBHY Chapter 4 argues that your boss can only help if you send two clear signals they can act on: what you are doing and why it matters, and what could derail it before it becomes a surprise. Producing OSS Chapter 8 extends that idea to communities, where leadership is less about authority and more about shaping the environment through norms, contribution pathways, and public, consistent decision making.

In a project where contributors have different levels of commitment, how do you use Chapter 4’s “two messages” to keep the work moving and prevent a few people from doing all the behind the scenes maintenance? If only a small group is handling most implementation, reviews, and releases, what should be said publicly to set expectations for everyone, and what should be said privately to the most active contributors, so the workload gets shared without pushing people away?
