\# Week 4 Question - HYBHY Chapter 4 + Producing OSS Chapter 8

\## Question



In \*Help Your Boss Help You\* Chapter 4, the author says we should send our boss two messages: \*\*“I got this”\*\* (I’ll take responsibility) and \*\*“I got your back”\*\* (we’re a team and I won’t blame you).



In \*Producing Open Source Software\* Chapter 8, the author says leaders should manage volunteers carefully—especially by making requests feel like \*\*an invitation, not an order\*\*, and by following up in a respectful way.



So here’s my question:  

\*\*How can someone leading an open source project ask a contributor to do a task in a way that still sends both messages (“I got this” and “I got your back”) without making the person feel forced, punished for being good at it, or like the leader is “the owner”?\*\*



\## Context (optional)



I’m thinking about how trust works in both places: with a boss at work and with volunteers in open source.
