## Question
In a technical meritocracy, does sending the "I got your back" message (publicly defending a manager's flawed decision) build "constructive loyalty," or does it actually deplete one's "credibility"—which Fogel defines as a finite, shared resource? If status is earned through "detailed, dispassionate criticism", is the most loyal move toward the group’s goals to publicly challenge a manager’s error to prevent technical "fragility"?
