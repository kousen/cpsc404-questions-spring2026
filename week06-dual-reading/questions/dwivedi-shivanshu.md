# My Question - Combnining Both Readings

## At work, there may arise multiple scenarios in which the project starts slipping due to missed milestone or some product bug, how can someone effectively communicate "I got this" to the people above them and "I got your back" to protect leadership credibility, while also managing the politics of contributors so the team doesn't fracture into blame or territoriality ?

## Note: This question has been something that has troubled me in different researches, startups and internships at multiple times.
