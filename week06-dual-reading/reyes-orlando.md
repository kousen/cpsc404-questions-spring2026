#Week 6 Question - Chapter 4 - Sending the Important Two Messages / Chapter 8 - Managing Participants

**Student:** Orlando Reyes

##Question
Kousen argues in Chapter 4 that every interaction with your manager should consciously reinforce two messages "I got this" (ownership and responsibility) and "I got your back" (team loyalty) as the foundation of a functional professional relationship. These messages are deliberately directed upward at someone with institutional power over your career. Fogel, in Chapter 8, describes a world where authority must remain informal and consensual, where the same messages of ownership and loyalty exist but flow laterally and organically and where actively claiming authority, rather than earning it, is a dysfunction he calls "cookie licking."
Fogel writes that "appearing to be above politics is merely one particular political strategy" and Kousen implicitly agrees, coaching employees on how to strategically signal loyalty and competence to protect their careers. But Fogel's chapter also insists that in open source, status must be granted by the group rather than performed for a superior. Does Kousen's framework built on managing upward perception produce the kind of contributor Fogel actually wants in an open source project? Or does it produce exactly the kind of politically savvy, credit-conscious operator that Fogel warns against when he discusses territoriality and cookie licking?
