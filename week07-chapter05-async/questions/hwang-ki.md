## Question
In a technical meritocracy, is a manager’s decision-making based on "inadequate information" a structural form of adverse selection? If a professional possesses superior data but chooses to "go along" to avoid conflict, are they "defecting" in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma by allowing the manager to make a "bad trade," or is immediate "pushing back" the only way to "train" the manager to value technical truth over political safety?

## Context
At the company I'm joing after graduation (Jane Street, a trading firm), we frequently discuss adverse selection as the risk of being the less-informed party in a trade. The book argues that managers "live in fear" because they must make high-stakes decisions with incomplete data. If I have the technical expertise to see a flaw but stay quiet, I am following the "Game of School"—satisfying the "teacher" in the short term—but violating the "Game of Business" by failing to act as a "valued ally" who protects the manager from organizational risk.
