# Week 4 Question - Chapter 3: Creating Constructive Loyalty

**Student:** Hyun Lee
**Date:** February 11, 2026

## Question
If the chapter advises against criticizing your manager in public, where should employees bring concerns, frustrations, or reports of harm so that they are handled safely and productively? What makes a feedback channel “good” (e.g., credibility, protection from retaliation, effectiveness, transparency, follow-through)?


## Context
Chapter 3 emphasizes the value of “constructive loyalty” and warns that criticizing a manager publicly can damage trust and long-term working relationships—even when the frustration feels justified. At the same time, the chapter acknowledges that power and information asymmetries exist and that some issues cannot be solved through informal conversations alone. This question is meant to explore how employees can preserve a professional working relationship while still raising legitimate concerns—especially when the concern involves potential harm, unfairness, or patterns of behavior that may require documentation and formal action.
