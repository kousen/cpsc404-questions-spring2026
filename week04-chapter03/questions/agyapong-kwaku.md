## Question

While the chapter focuses more on the vertical movement of loyalty between employees/managers there isn't much of a discussion about the lateral application. As a new hire in an entry level role its difficult to inspire the confidence of team members or peers on the same level since there may be competition to outperform each other. I'd like to ask how we can establish trust laterally to make work easier but also find allies that are not in direct control of your success but could give you a great assist.
